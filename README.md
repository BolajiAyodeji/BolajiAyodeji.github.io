# Hello World!

I'm a Front-end Developer and Technical Writer who currently works in Developer Relations at [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com). I'm passionate about communities, documentation, web VR experiences, developing JAMstack + PWA applications with a significant focus on accessibility alongside supporting and sustaining FOSS.

I create technical content on my [Blog](https://bolajiayodeji.com) && [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/bolajiayodeji), [speak](https://bolajiayodeji.com/talks) at a couple of technical events and organize several events && programs for my [local community](https://facebook.com/groups/devclokoja/).
