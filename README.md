# Hi 👋🏾

I'm a JAMstack Developer and Content Creator who currently works as a Developer Advocate at [Commerce Layer](https://commercelayer.io). I'm passionate about sharing knowledge, documentation, web engineering, JAMstack, communities, and FOSS. I create technical content on my [Blog](https://blog.bolajiayodeji) && [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/bolajiayodeji), speak at some conferences/meetups and build technical communities.
